# Facilitator Timing Guide

Run-of-show for all three sessions. Each day runs **12:30 to 4:00 PM (210 minutes)**. This guide maps the student reference docs to time blocks, places breaks, and leaves buffer. It's for facilitators. Students follow their own session reference docs.

## Ground rules that protect the clock

- **Prerequisites are done before Day 1.** Accounts (GitHub/Supabase/Vercel) and installs (Node/VS Code/Git) are not class time. Verify them in the first 10 minutes, don't perform them. See [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md).
- **Two breaks per day** (about 10 min each), plus a start buffer and a wrap buffer.
- **Checkpoints are hard stops.** If most of the room isn't at the checkpoint, use buffer time before moving on.
- **Session 2 is the tight one** (provisioning a backend). It has the least slack, so guard it.

## Standard day skeleton

| Block | Time | Minutes |
|-------|------|---------|
| Arrival + setup check | 12:30 to 12:40 | 10 |
| Work block 1 | 12:40 to 1:30 | 50 |
| Break 1 | 1:30 to 1:40 | 10 |
| Work block 2 | 1:40 to 2:40 | 60 |
| Break 2 | 2:40 to 2:50 | 10 |
| Work block 3 | 2:50 to 3:40 | 50 |
| Wrap + checkpoint + Q&A | 3:40 to 4:00 | 20 |
| **Total** | **12:30 to 4:00** | **210** |

Working time is about **160 min/day** (50+60+50), with 30 min of structured non-work (arrival, wrap) and 20 min of breaks. The wrap block doubles as **buffer**. If a work block overruns, borrow from wrap.

## Day 1: Build the Storefront

Maps to [Session 1 Reference](./Session-1-Setup-Reference.md). Goal: a live, personalized catalog on the student's own Vercel URL.

| Time | Activity | Doc step |
|------|----------|----------|
| 12:30 to 12:40 | Arrival. Confirm GitHub login works, `node -v` and `git --version` pass | Prereqs check |
| 12:40 to 1:00 | Welcome and three-tier architecture overview (keep to 20 min) |  |
| 1:00 to 1:30 | Fork, clone, run locally (`npm install`, `npm run dev`) | Steps 1 to 2 |
| 1:30 to 1:40 | **Break 1** |  |
| 1:40 to 2:20 | Deploy to own Vercel. Get live URL | Step 3 |
| 2:20 to 2:40 | Customize landing page (`content/site.ts`) | Step 4 |
| 2:40 to 2:50 | **Break 2** |  |
| 2:50 to 3:40 | Customize catalog (`content/listings.ts` and `public/images/`) | Step 5 |
| 3:40 to 4:00 | **Checkpoint:** catalog and forms render on live URL. Q&A | Session 1 checklist |

**Risk and buffer:** the `npm install` and first local run is the most likely snag (Node path issues). If it runs long, trim the architecture talk and borrow from the wrap block. Deployment is usually smooth since Vercel auto-detects Next.js.

## Day 2: Make It Real (Provision Your Backend) ⚠️ tightest day

Maps to [Session 2 Reference](./Session-2-Setup-Reference.md). Goal: the student's own Supabase backend connected, with a test inquiry, receipt, and donation persisting. This day has the most steps and the least slack.

| Time | Activity | Doc step |
|------|----------|----------|
| 12:30 to 12:40 | Arrival. Confirm Supabase login works |  |
| 12:40 to 1:00 | Recap and how the backend fits (DB, Auth, Storage, RLS). Keep it brief |  |
| 1:00 to 1:30 | Create Supabase project. Run `db/setup.sql` | Steps 1 to 2 |
| 1:30 to 1:40 | **Break 1** |  |
| 1:40 to 2:10 | Load listings via `/setup` (or `db/seed.sql`). Turn off "Confirm email" | Steps 3 to 4 |
| 2:10 to 2:40 | Copy keys. Set `.env.local` and Vercel env. Redeploy | Steps 5 to 6 |
| 2:40 to 2:50 | **Break 2** |  |
| 2:50 to 3:30 | Add GCash QR (`gcash-qr.png`, `content/payment.ts`). Save test data: 1 inquiry, 2 receipts from 2 accounts, 2 donations | Steps 7 to 8 |
| 3:30 to 4:00 | **Checkpoint:** test inquiry, receipt, and donation persist. Q&A and buffer | Session 2 checklist |

**Risk and buffer (read this one closely):**
- **Project provisioning wait** (1 to 2 min) and **SQL errors from partial copies** are the top time sinks. Tell students to copy the *entire* `db/setup.sql`. Keep the script idempotent so a re-run fixes a partial run.
- **Key and env mistakes** are the second sink: a wrong key in the wrong variable, or forgetting to set them on Vercel *and* redeploy. Walk the three-variable table on screen, and stress that the `service_role` key is server-only.
- This day gives the checkpoint block 30 min (instead of 20) on purpose, because stragglers are most likely here. If the room is on track, use the extra time for the payment customization polish.
- **Fallback if a student is stuck on Supabase:** they can keep customizing `content/` files locally and connect the backend during Day 3's arrival buffer. The catalog still renders without the backend.

## Day 3: Operate the Business

Maps to [Session 3 Reference](./Session-3-Setup-Reference.md). Goal: seed own roles, run every dashboard, final deploy.

| Time | Activity | Doc step |
|------|----------|----------|
| 12:30 to 12:40 | Arrival. Help any Day 2 backend stragglers catch up |  |
| 12:40 to 1:10 | Register 3 accounts on live site. Run `db/seed-roles.sql` to set Admin/Staff | Step 1 |
| 1:10 to 1:30 | Inquiry triage dashboard | Step 2 |
| 1:30 to 1:40 | **Break 1** |  |
| 1:40 to 2:20 | Receipt review: approve to MEMBER, reject with reason | Step 3 |
| 2:20 to 2:40 | Donation review: verify and reject | Step 4 |
| 2:40 to 2:50 | **Break 2** |  |
| 2:50 to 3:20 | Admin: manage listings and assign roles | Step 5 |
| 3:20 to 3:35 | Security demo: 403 / RLS blocks access | Step 6 |
| 3:35 to 4:00 | Final deploy. Showcase classmates' sites. Wrap | Step 7 |

**Risk and buffer:** role seeding is the one setup step. Everything after is operating finished UI, so it moves quickly. The security demo (Step 6) is the signature teaching moment, so protect at least 15 min for it even if earlier blocks slip.

## If you fall behind (priority order)

Keep these. Cut the rest if time is short:

1. **Day 1:** a live deployed site (even with default content) beats perfect customization.
2. **Day 2:** backend connected and one persisted test record beats payment polish.
3. **Day 3:** approving a receipt (membership granted) and the 403/RLS security demo beats listing/role management.

The three "wow" moments to land, one per day: **it's live** (Day 1), **it saves real data** (Day 2), and **I approved a payment and the security really blocks people** (Day 3).

## Quick reference: working time math

- Window: 210 min/day.
- Minus arrival (10), two breaks (20), and wrap/buffer (20), that leaves about **160 min of core working time**.
- Day 2 is the binding constraint. Its steps are sequenced so a stuck step (provisioning) doesn't block the next one, since customizing `content/` can proceed in parallel.
