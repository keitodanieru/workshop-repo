/**
 * app/api/inquiries/route.ts — public inquiry submission (Route Handler).
 *
 * Implements the design's `submitInquiry` algorithm and Flow 1. This endpoint
 * is PUBLIC: it accepts submissions with no authentication (Requirements 4.1,
 * 6.5). When the submitter IS authenticated, their verified user id is attached
 * as `owner_id` so they can later see their own inquiry (owner read via RLS);
 * anonymous submissions leave `owner_id` null.
 *
 * Order of checks mirrors the algorithm and the HTTP status conventions in
 * tech.md:
 *   1. Validate input — non-empty name, well-formed email, non-empty details.
 *      On failure respond 400 with field-level errors and PERSIST NOTHING
 *      (Requirements 4.2, 4.5).
 *   2. Confirm the `listing_id` references a listing that is published/active
 *      at submission time. A missing/unpublished/invalid listing is a 400
 *      (Requirements 4.3, 4.4; Correctness Property 4). The lookup goes through
 *      the role-aware server client, so RLS decides whether the row is visible
 *      — an anon/USER submitter cannot "see" an unpublished listing, so it is
 *      correctly treated as invalid.
 *   3. Sanitize name + details (Requirement 4.6) and insert with status NEW,
 *      returning 201 with the new inquiry id (Requirement 4.2).
 *
 * All DB access uses the Supabase query builder (parameterized), never
 * string-built SQL (Requirement 14.5). Upstream failures return a generic 500
 * with no internal diagnostics (Requirement 14.6).
