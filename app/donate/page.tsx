/**
 * Donate page — PUBLIC donation flow (design Flow 3), no account required.
 *
 * Layout: the GCash payment panel (fetched from
 * `/api/donations/payment-info`, which reads the editable content/payment.ts)
 * sits beside the public donation form. The form rejects a non-positive amount,
 * validates the receipt file, and persists the donation as PENDING for manual
 * verification; donors may stay anonymous by omitting both name and email.
 *
 * Composes the Task 6.5 design system (Requirement 15): both panels are built
 * from the shared primitives and token classes (no inline/hardcoded design
 * values), and the required loading / error / interactive states live in the
 * two client components (PaymentInfoPanel, DonationForm).
 *
 * Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.10, 10.1, 15.
