/**
 * StatusBadge — maps a record status to a token-driven color (Requirement 15.4).
 *
 * Covers every status across the domain models (structure.md): membership
 * receipts (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), inquiries (NEW/IN_PROGRESS/CLOSED),
 * and donations (PENDING/VERIFIED/REJECTED). Colors come from the status tokens
 * in theme.css so dark/light parity holds and nothing is hardcoded
 * (Requirements 15.1, 15.2). Used by the Staff/Admin dashboards (tasks 9.x).
