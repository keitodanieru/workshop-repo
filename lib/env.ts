/**
 * env.ts — THE ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT (do not edit to add real keys here)
 *
 * This module is the single, typed source of truth for the three environment
 * variables this app uses. It documents — and enforces at the type level —
 * which variables are PUBLIC and which is SERVER-ONLY.
 *
 * Students never edit this file. You provide values by copying `.env.example`
 * to `.env.local` and pasting your own Supabase keys. See `.env.example`.
 *
 * The contract (Requirements 14.3 and 14.4):
 *   - PUBLIC (prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, safe in the browser bundle):
 *       NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
 *       NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
 *   - SERVER-ONLY (never prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, never sent to the browser):
 *       SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
 *
 * NOTE: This task (2.1) only defines the env contract. The Supabase client
 * factories that consume these values are built in task 2.2.
 */

/**
 * Public environment variables.
 *
 * These are safe to read from both client and server components because they
 * carry the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix and are therefore inlined into the client
 * bundle by Next.js at build time.
 *
 * Next.js statically replaces `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` references, so they
 * are accessed by their full literal names rather than computed dynamically.
