/**
 * auth.ts — SERVER-SIDE auth & role helpers (application-layer 401/403 + UX).
 *
 * This module turns a request's Supabase session into a trusted role and
 * provides the `assertRole` guard that route handlers and server actions reuse.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the boundary this does (and does NOT) enforce:
 *   - Row Level Security is the AUTHORITATIVE access boundary. The database
 *     decides which rows each role may read/write, using a role resolved from
 *     the verified session (`auth.uid()` → `profiles.role`) inside its policies.
 *   - The helpers here exist ONLY to produce friendly 401/403 responses and to
 *     drive UX (hiding controls). They never re-implement the access logic that
 *     belongs in the database. Even if an `assertRole` call were bypassed, RLS
 *     still forbids the underlying row access.
 *
 * How the role is trusted (never client-supplied):
 *   - We use the ROLE-AWARE server client (`createServerSupabaseClient`), which
 *     reads the Supabase session JWT from cookies. `supabase.auth.getUser()`
 *     verifies that JWT against the Supabase Auth server, so an invalid or
 *     expired token yields no user. An invalid/expired/absent session is
 *     therefore treated as UNAUTHENTICATED.
 *   - The role itself is read from `profiles` keyed by the authenticated user's
 *     id — the same server-resolved source RLS uses — never from any value the
 *     client sends.
 *
 * `import 'server-only'` guarantees a build-time error if this module is ever
 * pulled into a Client Component, keeping session/role resolution on the server.
 *
 * Requirements: 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 14.1, 14.2
 * (Design: Component 5 — Auth & Role Resolution; `assertRole` algorithm.)
